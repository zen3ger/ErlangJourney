# ErlangJourney

I decided to learn *Erlang* for fun, so this repo is going to be the collection of smaller
programs/code challange solutions during my journey of learning the language.

So, don't expect to see anything _too serious_ here.

## PRs and issues:
If you find anything that I did awfully wrong, please *open* and issue or *PR*!

## Code reuse
If this code in whatever way benefit you, take it (unless any any source directory contains a LICENSE file)!
